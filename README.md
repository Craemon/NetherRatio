# NetherRatio

**Moved to:** https://github.com/Craemon/Datapacks
This datapack changes the conversion ratio (Overworld <> Nether) from the default(8:1) to a ratio of 2:1.

It also introduces an adjusted coordinate calculator for that ratio(original is made by vanilla tweaks)
The calculator can be used by using "/trigger" and then the specific addition of Overworld/ Nether depending on what dimension you're in.
